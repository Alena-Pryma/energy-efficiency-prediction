# Energy Efficiency Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with Machine Learning project: an end-to-end analysis and models to predict Heating Load (Y1) and Cooling Load (Y2) for buildings using the UCI Energy Efficiency dataset.

## Key files
- `notebooks/Energy_efficiency.ipynb` — main Jupyter Notebook with EDA, modeling and conclusions
- `data/ENB2012_data.xlsx` — dataset (UCI Energy Efficiency)
- `use_case_documentation/Screenshots_documentation.pdf` - screenshots of the completed use case template on the platform [appliedAI Institute’s Use Case Platform](https://ucp.appliedai-institute.de/en)
- `reports/` - graphs and charts
- `README.md` — project description

## Summary of results
- Models compared: Linear Regression, Random Forest
- Heating Load (Y1): Random Forest R² = 0.998, RMSE = 0.49
- Cooling Load (Y2): Random Forest R² = 0.968, RMSE = 1.71
